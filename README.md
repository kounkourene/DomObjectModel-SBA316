Description of the project:
Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML and CSS
This project consisted of building a web application called Note Manager that allows users to update the notes: 
Functionalities: 
- Search : Users can search any note by typing any letter lower case or Upser case. Both cases will give the same results.
- Hide notes: Users have the ability to hide the notes if they dont want them to be visible.
- Add notes: Users can have the note to the list of an already existing notes. They can also edit, update or delete the notes.
- Sign in: Users can choose to sign in or not. It is not mandatory to sign in in order to update their notes. The Sign in functionality here is to demonstrate the Email and Pasword validations. For example if you do not include a @ or . in the email field, you will get an alert saying invalid email.
